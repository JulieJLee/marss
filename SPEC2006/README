The assignment requires the experimentation with a selection of benchmarks
originated from SPEC CPU2006 and MediaBench v2 suites.

SPEC CPU2006 suite: 
401.bzip2  
429.mcf  
433.milc  
445.gobmk  
456.hmmer  
458.sjeng  
462.libquantum
464.h264ref  
470.lbm  

MediaBench Suite:
h263dec  
h263enc  
mpeg2dec  
mpeg2enc

Every benchmark directory contains a source file (src), a data file (data)
with the input data and a run.sh script that runs the benchmark. Each src
directory contains a Makefile that automates the compilation. You can redefine
the compiler flags with the CFLAGS variable.

Please fill free to use your favorite scripting language to automate the
experimental procedure. For time measurement you can use the GNU time, bash time 
or time function calls and hardware counters if you write a measurement tool. 
The selection of the tools and techniques is part of the experimental setup and
every choice is considered "right" if it is justified in your report.


For any problem please contact me at c.margiolas@ed.ac.uk with an e-mail subject
starting with "COPT ASSIGNMENT".
